Not happy at all. Second time out the backs of the sneakers dug into my ankles causing discomfort and bleeding. Very disappointed.:Negative
These Brooks shoes are great! I run every few days, and the Ghost 13's are a game changer!:Positive
Worst running shoe ever.:Negative
This is honestly one of the best shoes I have ever bought. Think you like the shoes you currently have forget about it!:Positive
Well I used the shoes for couple of weeks to get my feet and running used to them. I progressively became slower and my shin pain also became worse. I got these shoes as it accommodated my running style but it actually hurt me. They also run small so go half a size bigger if you want to try them:Negative
Just do it. you won't regret it. great support, super light, super fast and just the right amount of bounce. awesome shoe.:Positive
Was so excited to get these, only to get heal blisters after one 30 minute power walk around our community center. Had to return them.:Negative
Go up 1/2 size for the best fit. My son and daughter, who are runners, love Brooks!:Positive
Fit tight:Negative
Lightweight and comfortable. Good arch support and the 'normal' width seems to work fine for my feet. The sole is just stiff enough to give support without feeling like your walking on rigid slats:Positive
Iâ€™ve had these shoes for one month and the soles are already separating from the shoes. This is my fifth pair of Brooks Ghost model shoes and it may be time to move onto another brand:Negative
I have foot problems and find this shoe supportive and comfortable for all day wear:Positive
